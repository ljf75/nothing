# Roles

## Project Leader

Current Project Leader: [@rexim]

- Project Leader is fully responsible for the project.
- If something doesn't work blame Project Leader for that. Not the Contributor who introduced a bug. If the Project Leader did their job well they would not accept the changes in the first place.
- Project Leader defines these rules and their interpretation.

## Contributor

Contributors are welcome to submit Issues and Pull Requests according to the rules below. If the rules are not clear, ask the Project Leader on what to do in any particular situation.

### Issues

- Feel free to submit an issues in case of
  - bug
  - suggestion
  - feature request
  - question regarding the project
  - unclear documentation
  - unreadable or straight up bad code
  - any problem that you ran into while setting up the project on your side
- Do not submit **Tasks**. Submit **Problems**.
  - Bad issue: "Rewrite everything in Rust"
  - Good issue: "Using C makes the development difficult"
  - We are engineers. We don't follow anybody's direction. We solve problems. Please submit problems.

### Pull Requests

- Keep your PRs nice and small around 300 changes (including adding new lines). PRs that are way over that threshold won't be merged. Exceptions may apply if the reasons for a bigger PRs are communicated properly to the Project Leader in the description of the Pull Request.
  - If 300 changes is not enough,
    - make as many changes as you can according to the PR size limitation,
    - make sure that the code is compilable and the application is usable,
    - create TODOs right in the code for the unfinished work,
    - submit PR with the unfinished work and TODOs,
    - TODOs will be converted to separate issues
- Neglected PRs older than two weeks may be closed by Project Leader at any time.
- Don't get discouraged if your PR was not merged. The Rules and CI are designed to keep the quality of the code high so you don't have to worry about it yourself. Keep experimenting, keep improving.
